# Nuclear Shelter
In this map the player will play the classic Domination mode from FPS Shooter games such as Call of Duty or Counter Strike: Global Offensive. 
There are two teams in this mode where they will have to capture three bases along the map as long as they battle against each other. The bases are: A for Alpha, B for Bravo, and C for Charlie (as it was mentioned before). In Domination the player will obtain points by capturing zones each time. When one side gets the maximum points before the rival, they win the game.
