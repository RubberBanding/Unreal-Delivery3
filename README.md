# The Riven Tower
When a battalion of soldiers from World War I disappears in the transylvanian mountains of Făgăraș, you, a villager that knows the mountains, offer your services to track and save them. Your quest brings you to the Riven Tower, where forgotten creatures from an ancient time hide themselves from society. Explore the tower and battle the monsters to find the missing battalion and while you are at it, encover the terrible secrets that hide this mysterious tower.
